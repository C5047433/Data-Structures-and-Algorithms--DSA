Problem Description
You are given an array A of length N and Q queries given by the 2D array B of size QÃ—2.
Each query consists of two integers B[i][0] and B[i][1].
For every query, your task is to find the count of even numbers in the range from A[B[i][0]] to A[B[i][1]].


Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= Q <= 10^5
1 <= A[i] <= 10^9
0 <= B[i][0] <= B[i][1] < N


Input Format
First argument A is an array of integers.
Second argument B is a 2D array of integers.


Output Format
Return an array of integers.


Example Input
Input 1:
A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
B = [   [0, 2] 
        [2, 4]
        [1, 4]   ]
Input 2:
A = [2, 1, 8, 3, 9, 6]
B = [   [0, 3]
        [3, 5]
        [1, 3] 
        [2, 4]   ]


Example Output
Output 1:
[1, 1, 2]
Output 2:
[2, 1, 1, 1]


Example Explanation
For Input 1:
The subarray for the first query is [1, 2, 3] (index 0 to 2) which contains 1 even number.
The subarray for the second query is [3, 4, 5] (index 2 to 4) which contains 1 even number.
The subarray for the third query is [2, 3, 4, 5] (index 1 to 4) which contains 2 even numbers.
For Input 2:
The subarray for the first query is [2, 1, 8, 3] (index 0 to 3) which contains 2 even numbers.
The subarray for the second query is [3, 9, 6] (index 3 to 5) which contains 1 even number.
The subarray for the third query is [1, 8, 3] (index 1 to 3) which contains 1 even number.
The subarray for the fourth query is [8, 3, 9] (index 2 to 4) which contains 1 even number.
